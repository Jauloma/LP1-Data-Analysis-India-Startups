## Project Description
Introduction
The world of startups has seen exponential growth in recent years, with innovative ideas and technologies disrupting various industries. One crucial aspect of any startup's success is funding, and the ability to secure funding can be a make-or-break factor in the early stages of a startup's life. In this context, we analyse four datasets containing information on funding received by startups across various sectors and stages in India from 2018 and 2021.

Objective: Our objective is to provide valuable insights into funding trends that can help organizations make informed decisions about their fundraising and budgeting activities.

Aim: Through this analysis, we aim to shed light on the current state of startup funding and identify areas of growth and opportunity for startups and investors alike.

## Setup
Data Collection:
For this project, we were provided with four datasets containing information on funding received by startups across various sectors and stages in India from 2018 and 2021. The datasets were obtained from a proprietary database and were selected based on specific criteria, including the startup's industry, funding stage, and location.

Data Preprocessing:
We conducted data preprocessing to ensure the quality and integrity of the data. We checked for missing values, outliers, and data inconsistencies and cleaned the data accordingly. We also imputed missing values where necessary. The cleaned data was used for further analysis.

Tools and Technologies:
We used Python, a programming language commonly used for data analysis, along with its rich libraries, including Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. These libraries were used to conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) and to visualize the data.

Analysis Approach:
Our analysis approach involved using EDA to gain insights into the datasets, followed by hypothesis testing to identify significant differences in funding between various sectors and stages. We used correlation matrix, t-test, and ANOVA to investigate the relationships between variables and to test for significant differences between groups.

Ethical Considerations:
We took ethical considerations into account by ensuring that the privacy of the data is protected. We used anonymized data and did not collect any personally identifiable information.
